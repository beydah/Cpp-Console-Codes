Is it worth taking the greatest risk of living, which is dying? To experience the pains, the joys, the hopes... Can someone who begins to forget memories be considered to have lived those memories? If they forget everything, can we still say, 'They lived'?
Keep Sleeping On - Wake up and Look Out the Window
One morning, after waking up from dreams, you saw a person's body on the edge of the pavement. No one was looking at that body, no one acknowledged its existence. Does something truly exist if nobody sees it? How much does an unknown entity exist, it is there?
Overlook someone who hasn't lived - Value someone who hasn't lived.
You recently saw the body of someone who never lived at the edge of a sidewalk. It looked like they had fallen from a great height. No one paid attention. They just passed by, stepping on it without noticing. They didn't even realize the soul that emerged from the broken bones. But then again, can someone who never lived have a soul? Shouldn't we love that soul, nurture it, and write poems for it?
End the conversation - Write an elegy for a man who never lived.
Today, I recognized the body of someone who never lived on a sidewalk. Most likely, no one saw them as they crossed bridges. No one stopped their metal steed to let them pass. No one cared about them. And that's why they fell from a great height. If nobody knows someone, if nobody cares, if nobody sees them, can we consider them to have lived? Today, while walking on the sidewalk, I recognized the body of a man who never lived. We killed him so that we could live. We didn't see him to be seen. We didn't listen to him to be heard. We didn't let him do things to feel accomplished. We didn't feed him so that we could eat. We didn't love him to be loved. We were so consumed with ourselves that today, we killed someone who never lived. I'm scared. Because we succeeded in killing someone who never lived, just because we didn't see him. 'Such crimes always happen in big cities. People are preoccupied with rushing to work, bringing bread home. They don't have time to stop and understand subtle things or even ignore them. Besides, I don't need to listen to someone else. I can hear myself. I don't need to love someone else. I am loved. I don't need to see someone else. I can see myself. I don't need to understand someone else. I am understood. Why don't you think the same way? Essentially, everyone thinks like this.' Not everyone. Before dying, the man who never lived didn't think like this. Even though he wanted what you wanted, deep down, he wanted to see, listen, understand, love, and live. Not merely survive. He wanted to live... 'To live, it is more than enough to see, to hear, to be understood, to be loved.' Not to live, but these are enough to survive. To live, you need to see, to listen, to understand, to love. Today, someone who never lived died. And this scares me because no one is truly living. They cannot live... because it all ends in death.
