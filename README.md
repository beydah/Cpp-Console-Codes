# C++ for Beginner

In this project, I present the basic algorithm problem codes I created while starting with software development and the C++ language. The codes include 10 different algorithm problems and 10 different Console Screen games, arranged from easy to difficult, allowing you to develop software skills and gain insight into game programming progressively. The codes in the project not only help improve fundamental C++ programming skills but also foster algorithmic thinking. As a result, programming skills and problem-solving abilities are developed step by step, enabling you to step into the world of software more proficiently.

The fundamental algorithm problems included in the project offer the opportunity to improve software skills by solving them step by step. By examining these codes, you can learn the basic structures of C++ and algorithm design. Additionally, problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking are enhanced, increasing intellectual capacity.

In conclusion, the codes of the basic algorithm problems in this project are ideal for developing programming skills and algorithmic thinking when entering the world of software. Solving problems step by step enhances mastery of the fundamental C++ language and enables approaching more complex software projects with greater confidence.

## Lessons Learned

While building these algorithms, I had the opportunity to develop my fundamental skills in the C++ programming language. I encountered various challenges, but I learned to solve these problems using debugging techniques and step-by-step approaches. Moreover, I discovered the importance of organizing code in a modular way and communicating between functions. In this project, I also grasped the significance of documentation and comments to make the code readable and understandable. Confronting all these challenges, I improved myself by practicing and utilizing external resources.
